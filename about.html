        <h3>our story</h3>
        <p> The success of an ecommerce website doesn’t solely depend on the quality of its products, there are a range of other factors at play. Two of the most important are how the site is marketed and how it is designed.An ecommerce site must have a top level domain with a secured connection. my site exclusively serves a certain country, then use a country code domain.Sometimes, a customer may be interested in a product but decide to buy it later. Or a customer may find a product interesting and want to check that later for more details. A wishlist allows them to store a list of these products so that they can easily find them next time they visit My site.</p>
        <p> My site should definitely let the customers register and login. It’s best to place this on the top bar for easy access.My ecommerce site has multiple versions for different regions, then you can include language options to let users switch between different languages/regions.</p>

                Add the item to your Shopping Cart and proceed to checkout.
                Choose a delivery address within the India (including select addresses in Alaska, Hawaii, india Territories, and P.O. boxes, but not APO, FPO, or DPO addresses) or an eligible export country.
                On the checkout page, select the guaranteed shipping option. Your delivery date will state "guaranteed" and be displayed on the final page before you place the order.
                Pay using your credit card or debit card. If your order contains items that aren't eligible for a delivery guarantee, you may be prompted to select an option indicating you'd like to split up your shipments (at an additional cost). Your items will be ineligible for the guarantee if you don't select this option.
                Place your order before the "order within" countdown displayed on the checkout page.  The "order within" countdown timer provides the window of time in which you must place the order to receive your delivery by the date shown. That delivery date may become unavailable within that window because of changes in inventory or delivery capacity before you place your order. We'll state your confirmed delivery date in your order confirmation email. Contact us if you have any concerns.
                1-Click orders, or orders placed with the "Buy Now" feature, may automatically receive guaranteed delivery in some circumstances. To determine if your order is eligible, proceed to checkout as described above.
